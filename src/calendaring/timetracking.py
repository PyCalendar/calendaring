"""The time log, mode-free: entries, their iCalendar form, and aggregation (API_DESIGN.md §3.4, roadmap 1.6).

Time spent is an append-only log of entries; the total is derived.  In
iCalendar an entry is a ``VEVENT`` marked ``X-PYCAL-TIME-ENTRY``, pointing
at the task or event the time was spent on with ``RELATED-TO``, and
naming who did the work with RFC 9073 ``PARTICIPANT`` components, never
with ``ATTENDEE`` (which would make a server send invitations).  The I/O
methods are on the collections and bound items; this module does no I/O.
