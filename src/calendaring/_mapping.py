"""Mode-free write planning: what a backend cannot store (§5.3), and what it stored differently (verify).

The generic layer derives losses from the capability table, so a backend
that declares a property ``UNSUPPORTED``, or ``LOSSY`` with ``values`` (and
optionally a ``map`` from a value to the one stored instead), gets the loss
check without code of its own.  A backend with mapping rules beyond that
overrides ``_plan_losses`` on its collection.
